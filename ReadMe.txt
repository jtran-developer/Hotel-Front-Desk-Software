An application created for my Software Design class, utilizing Java, MySQL and MVC. Full documentation included.

The purpose of this application is to manage all hotel reservations and other services, such as housekeeping, catering, and more.

As team leader, I designed the system architecture, distributed the necessary work, counciled team members who needed extra help, and also worked as one of the application's developer. Each team member is responsible for two use cases. In the 'Documentation' folder, the "Various Diagrams.pdf" gives more specific details I was responsible for. All other files are general information regarding the overview of the application.
